        ...So I'm sitting there, <Redacted>mustard on my titties</Redacted>, when this <Blurred>document</Blurred>
        jumps me and starts emptying my pockets of all my candy wrappers! I have no <Blurred>bloody</Blurred> clue why.
        Frankly, I don't even remember putting any candy wrappers in my pockets, but it was managing to pull them out anyway.
        I didn't wany those wrappers or anything, they're just trash, but I definitely didn't want it GETTING them so I started grabbing for em myself!

                The witness started screming and pointing at an empty corner of the room.
                A security officer was asked to examine the space. Within moments, the guard vanished into a cloud of black smoke.
                His next of kin were told the cause of death was smoke inhalation followed by spontaneous physical dissolvement.
