Site-09 isn't perfect at their job, and live specimens don't last forever.
The staff call the apparatus used to get rid of the garbage that comes their way "the incinerator" due to how it works, but in reality it's another OCP.

What are its properties?
Even the staff on site aren't sure, but they like to think it incinerates trash without harming the environment.
