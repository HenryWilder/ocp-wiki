name: Site-27
blurb: High depth storage
---

Creatures that need to be kept in high pressure environments and items found at the bottom of the ocean that have yet to be taken to the surface,
site-27 is a rough station to be in.

The longest site-27 has gone without being attacked by a Leviathan class entity is 5 days.
