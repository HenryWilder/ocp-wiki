name: Site-14
blurb: Live specimen containment
---

Arguably one of the most dangerous sites to be positioned at, certainly the most eventful. One cell might contain a friendly thought-inserting octopus, the next might contain a ravenous time-altering predator. Of course, site-14 doesn't just hold animals. Sapient plant-based entities are also held here. If something is alive, it's automatically unpredictable, and site-14 is prepared for whatever it has in store.
