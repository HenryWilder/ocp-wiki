name: Site-08
blurb: Initial inanimate object containment
---

If an anomaly is discovered that on the surface looks like it would be right at home in [site-03](site/03) or [site-04](site/04), it goes through here first.
After running a suitable number of tests to determine if it even belongs in such "be and leave be" style sites, site-08 will determine where it
should go and do their best to hypothesize what containment protocols would be best suited for the current specimen.

Site-08 is currently out of commission due to an accident involving an anomalous tennis racket.
