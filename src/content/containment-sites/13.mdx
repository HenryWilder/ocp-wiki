name: Site-13
blurb: Chaos Theory studies
---

Site-13 was originally made for a different purpose, but after dozens of horrible accidents in tests focusing on probability manipulating anomalies,
the original chaos theory studies department was temporarily moved to site-13.
After everything on site began running smoothly for over a month, site-13 was officially rebranded as the new chaos theory studies department.
