        ...So I'm sitting there, <Redacted>mustard on my titties</Redacted>, when this <Blurred>document</Blurred>
        jumps me and starts emptying my pockets of all my candy wrappers! I have no <Blurred>bloody</Blurred> clue why.
        Frankly, I don't even remember putting any candy wrappers in my pockets, but it was managing to pull them out anyway.
        I didn't wany those wrappers or anything, they're just trash, but I definitely didn't want it GETTING them so I started grabbing for em myself!

            This part gets cut off.
            
            The witness started screming and pointing at an empty corner of the room.
            A security officer was asked to examine the space. Within moments, the guard vanished into a cloud of black smoke.
            His next of kin were told the cause of death was smoke inhalation followed by spontaneous physical dissolvement.

            For the record, can we please not let the interns write the cover stories anymore?
