## Optimal Containment Protocols
All known instances of OCP-013 are to be kept in a cubical containment cell suspended 8 meters off the ground via magnetic device.
Should a new instance be discovered, [MTF-4.3 (Hot Potatoes)](mtf/4dot3) are to be contacted in order to retrieve it.

## Description
OCP-013 is the collective designation for an anomalous type of metal with a similar atomic makeup to <Blurred>[OCP-073](ocp/073)</Blurred>.
The reason for which is somewhat self explanatory. There are currently 70kg worth of 10 individual bars within containment.
OCP-013 is ectoentroptic, permanently fixed at exactly -43Â° celsius.
Physical contact with OCP-013 has a high chance of resulting in death, and is ill advised.
Additionally, exposure to OCP-013 has been known to induce emotional numbness for varying amounts of time, lasting longer with more exposure.
