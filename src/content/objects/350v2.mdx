## Optimal Containment Protocols
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is to be held within a standard humanoid containment cell encased in <Redacted>xxxxxxxxxxxxxx</Redacted>, to prevent teleportation.

A minimum 2.5ml sample of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) reserved for tracking purposes is to be contained on [site-07.<Redacted>##</Redacted>](site/07) at all times.
More is permitted, but not less.

In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Force [K-nis (Bloodhounds)](mtf/k-nis) is to be dispatched for subject tracking.

## Description
OCP-350 is a pair of objects designated "[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)" and "[OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2)".

The anomalous properties of OCP-350 include [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s ability to teleport great distances.
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) seems to teleport sparingly.
Because of this, it is theorized the anomaly only activates when OCP-350-1 is in immenent danger.
This ability is often associated with what appears to be a spray of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2), believed to be a self-defense mechanism.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is a 1m tall, female humanoid most closely related to the species Acerodon Jubatus (giant golden-crowned flying fox).
The object's most distinguishing feature is a pattern of small, circle-like shapes across the skin, where the epidermis & dermis are thin enough
for the muscle to be visible. [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s muscle scatters light similarly to the sky (appearing blue under direct, white light),
as well as emitting a purple glow at an intensity of 0.325 lumens. Testing has confirmed this is as a result of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) "staining" the muscle.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) displays both sentience and sapience, as well as basic fluency in the English language.
It is capable of carrying on full conversations in a wide range of subjects.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) has a strong tendency towards disobeying orders and general non-compliance.
It can be made to cooperate in exchange for rewards in the form of fruit.

[OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) is a translucent black, mutated slime mold (Myxomycete) of variable density.
DNA tests show the object to be most closely related to the species Physarum Polycephalum.\
Like [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s muscle, [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) scatters incoming blue light, and emits a purple glow at an intensity of 3 lumens per gram.

[OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) is genetically and biologically linked to its host, [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1).
In addition to sharing identical DNA, the two objects share a symbiotic bond: [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s body naturally produces [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) as if it were its own blood.
In return, [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) circulates oxygen and nutrients through [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s cardiovascular system, further acting as blood.

## Discovery
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) was discovered on <RedactedDate/> breaking into a local 24-hr convenience store at <Blurred>0226</Blurred>hrs.
The object was consuming a quantity of <Blurred>Frooti Tooti&trade;</Blurred>-brand packets of <Blurred>Bunni Gummis</Blurred>
(animal-shaped, artificial fruit-flavored gummy snacks) from a display stand it had knocked onto the floor.

When spotted on security cameras by night manager <Redacted>xxxxxxxxxxx</Redacted>, the night manager approached [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) in the main area.
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) acknowledged the night manager's presence, but ignored requests to compensate for damage and consumed product.
The night manager produced a <Redacted>model name</Redacted> shotgun from behind the front counter. When threatened,
the object vocalized hostility and hugged the unconsumed packets to its chest using its wings.
The night manager fired at [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1), causing [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) to teleport out of the way, splattering the floor with [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2).

Within a frame of the shot being fired, [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) can be seen the hiding on the opposite side of the display stands.

    Early on, it was suspected that OCP-350-1's anomalous property was faster-than-light speed, but later research--as well as a distinct
    absence of any air displacement shifting hanging products--quickly dispelled this theory.

OCP officials were soon dispatched to the site when the night manager called law enforcement reporting the termination,
and the communication was interrupted by a loud vocalization of distress from the night manager upon seeing [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)
walking around the corner to collect any packets of gummy snacks that may have survived the shotgun blast.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) was later captured and contained, using some of the [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) residue left behind in the convenience store to train
Mobile Task Force [K-nis (Bloodhounds)](mtf/k-nis) on its scent.
