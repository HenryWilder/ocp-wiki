## Optimal Containment Protocols

OCP-000 is to be posted on the OCP site in order to confirm the functional operation of the OCP database. No other protocols are needed at this time.

## Description

OCP-000 is a <Blurred>paper document regarding the task force [K-nis (Bloodhounds)](mtf/k-nis).</Blurred> Its origin is unknown, as it was never written by any past nor present researcher at the Federation.

What is known is that it mentions <Blurred>a hybrid between [OCP-051](ocp/051) and a hitherto unknown OCP described as a bat.</Blurred>

The contents of OCP-000 have been found to have come true. The previously unknown OCP described has been revealed to be the recently obtained [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1).

The original, anomalous copy of the document has gone missing. A digital backup copy of the document's content still exists. See the updated version of [OCP-051](ocp/051).
