## Optimal Containment Protocols
The house OCP-026 is located in is to be moved to [site-05](site/05) via heavy duty construction equipment.

## Description
OCP-026 is the designation given to the upstairs guest bedroom in a two story house previously located in <Redacted>Right Behind You</Redacted>,
just west of the Ganchorov border. The previous residents have been relocated according to Covosov immigration laws.
The majority of the house is perfectly normal, and does not warrant further study. However,
the upstairs guest bedroom and bathroom both possess several minor anomalous properties.
The temperature of both rooms is always slightly lower than the rest of the house,
the water pressure is always disproportionate to what the piping and valves would allow,
the floor is made of an unknown wood-like material, the carpet is made of an unidentified animal fur and cotton fibers from an unidentified plant,
the bed is always producing dust, the books contain several grammatical errors and some are in an unknown language.
