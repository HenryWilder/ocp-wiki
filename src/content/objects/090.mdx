## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-090 is uncontainable.\
It is a naturally occurring phenomenon that goes beyond the scope of even the Federation's capabilities.

A disinformation campaign has been launched to conceal the existence of OCP-090 by convincing the public that such an anomaly is ordinary and unremarkable.

## Description
When a sufficiently large star reaches the end of its life, it will collapse in on itself.
The result is a zero-dimensional point with <Redacted>potentially billions of</Redacted> times the solar mass.
OCP-090 is the name given to these objects, which are often referred to as <Redacted>black holes</Redacted>.

This point has a mathematically-proven density of <span style="background-color: var(--color-foreground); color: var(--color-background); font-family: serif; padding-inline: 0.5ch">undefined</span>,
which should by all rational logic be impossible.
The result is an astronomical body packed so tight with mass that causality breaks down.
The discontinuity of causality encloses the instance of OCP-090 within an anomalous bubble, a region completely cut off from the outside universe.
Inside this bubble, spacetime itself ceases to act like the "fabric" we are used to, and takes on traits more akin to a liquid.
Time no longer flows forward, and can in fact flow sideways as well as up and down.
Simultaneously, space is no longer a three-dimensional volume to be traversed through, becoming a singular dimension leading to the only reachable point in the universe: the OCP-090 instance itself.

While all instances of OCP-090 are fortunately very distant, they are disturbingly common and supremely dangerous.

A single OCP-090 instance the size of a moon can consume entire stars.
Potentially even multiple stars at once, if the instance is massive enough.
Horrifyingly, this is not even speculation.
Such activity has been observed, enough to even be considered the normal for these anomalies.

We can only hope that no OCP-090 instance ever comes within range of the solar system.
Due to OCP-090's causality-breaking properties, there is not even a theoretical way to stop them.
