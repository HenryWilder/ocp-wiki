## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-005 is kept in a basic storage crate in [site-04](site/04).

## Description
OCP-005 is a large wooden device composed of every single string instrument in history.
Occasionally, OCP-005 will "play" itself. There are no other anomalous properties present beyond not having any known maker.
