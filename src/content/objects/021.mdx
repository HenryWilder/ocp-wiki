## Optimal Containment Protocols
Should OCP-021 approach earth, a full assault is to be issued and mobilized.
All citizens of Hevenhie are to seek immediate shelter before the swarm arrives.
If anyone is not secured by the time OCP-021 arrives, they are to be abandoned.

## Description
OCP-021 is a swarm of roughly 2,000,000,000,000 mechanical insects currently drifting through space several hundred light years away.
They are approximately 5 meters long (from head to stinger) and composed of a head, torso, and thorax,
seven legs (three located on the thorax), 5 eyes, and 4 wings.
Their jaws are capable of tearing through steel with relative ease.
They appear to be incapable of moving through space on their own.
The reason the Federation knows about their existence is because a single instance landed on earth, which allowed the Federation to locate the rest of the swarm.
The instance killed 80 civilians before [MTF-H25](mtf/h25) managed to subdue it.
Vivisection revealed that OCP-021 have stingers filled with a liquid that will cause lethal subconjunctival hemorrhaging once injected into a very specific creature.
Otherwise, this liquid is almost completely harmless due to not being able to affect earthling DNA.
