## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-025 is to be kept in an empty field with a concrete wall surrounding an 8 kilometer radius around it.
Development of a dust collecting device that can safely filter the air coming out of the designated red zone is currently underway,
and is considered a high priority. Anything observed entering the area is considered lost.

## Description
OCP-025 is a small dresser-like structure composed of wood. Its manufacturer is unknown.
The dresser itself contains a large amount of dust particles and hair, as well as several articles of non anomalous clothing covered in dust.

OCP-025 was discovered in a vacant town encased in dust. Originally, the town itself was considered anomalous. his was revised after several exploration attempts.
During exploration, the team retrieved the dresser.
Upon bringing it into Federation custody, dust began to encase the entire site it was held within, while the town's properties were nullified.

After careful observation, it has been discovered that OCP-025 causes any empty space within a 7 kilometer radius to be filled with dust particles,
as well as transmute organic matter to dust. This often results in asphyxiation and death.
This process continues until the radius has a 1:6 ratio of dust to atmosphere (1cm&sup3; of dust for every 6cm&sup3; of atmosphere)
and a 24:1 ratio of dust to organic matter (24cm&sup3; of dust for every 1cm&sup3; of organic matter).
It takes roughly 17 hours for OCP-025 to generate 3 grams of dust, which is slowed down when transmuting organic matter.

## Addenda
### Addendum 1
Containment has proven more difficult than anticipated. It appears OCP-025 is also turning the soil below it into dust, and slowly sinking into the ground as a result.
