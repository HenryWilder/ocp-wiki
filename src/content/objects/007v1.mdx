## Optimal Containment Protocols
Victims were to be placed in a comatose state for the duration of their remaining lives to minimize misery.

## Description
OCP-007 is an auditory condition in which a laugh track plays when bad things happen to the infected individual
(there is only ever one) until they die from an accident, at which point it moves to the next victim, only one voice louder.
The laughter can only be heard by the individual, though the effects of the noise do cause physical effects.
All victim souls have been recovered without difficulties, and the bad luck and laughing stop post mortise,
so it doesn't threaten society. It's just scary, exponential, and unstoppable. All attempts to terminate victims,
as well as victim attempts to self-terminate, have failed, and resulted in more laughter. Incidents completely ceased once the laughing got 
so loud it killed its victim immediately, (total of <Redacted>alottafucking</Redacted> voices).
The victim died with ruptured eardrums, a melted brain, collapsed lungs, and a shattered skull.
