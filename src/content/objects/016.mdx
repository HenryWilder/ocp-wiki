## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-016 is kept in [Z5-2](staff/z5-2)'s office at all times.

## Description
OCP-016 is a small golden pocket watch.
The one and only anomalous property OCP-016 possesses is that it functions perfectly despite a single essential gear being absent.
A non anomalous, yet still strange property of OCP-016 is that it has 13 hours instead of 12.
