## Optimal Containment Protocols
All citizens of all classes are to be informed of the existence of OCP-029 and its properties as quickly as possible.
All houses in Havenhie are to be provided with unlimited access to [SCP-500](scp/500) daily.

## Description
OCP-029 is a randomly occurring spree of mass psychogenic illness that causes infected individuals to go through two distinct “phases”.
The only known cure is through use of other OCPs. Stage 1 is relatively harmless, consisting purely of mild to severe coughing fits.
During this time, subjects exhibit no additional abnormal or obviously problematic symptoms. Stage 1 lasts approximately ten minutes at least.
Afterwards, OCP-029 becomes much more dangerous. Infected individuals will cease coughing, and all higher brain function will fail, leaving them in a blind,
uncontrollable rage. Stage 2 is also accompanied by fits of extreme violence towards all things, regardless of any factors.
Basically, if a person in stage 2 of infection sees something, they will attack it without pause.
To date, no physical cause has been found for OCP-029, such as a virus or neuron pattern.
OCP-029 cannot affect entities with one or more of the following traits:

- Possess true immortality
- Are incapable of dreaming
- Are unconscious
- Are non living or dead
- Do not possess a physical form
- Lack sentience

OCP-029 infection persists beyond death, resurrected individuals who were killed while in stage 2 will remain in stage 2.
According to <Blurred>[OCP-00](ocp/00)</Blurred>, a day will come when OCP-029 cases completely cease despite Hevenhie and all life in general still existing.
