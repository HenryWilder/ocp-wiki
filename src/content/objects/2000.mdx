## Optimal Containment Protocols
Federation surgeons and physicians are working around the clock to restore [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2)'s physical condition, in hopes of reversing their paralysis and extreme atrophy without accidentally terminating them.
A portable version of [OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1) is to be constructed for [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2).
Upon successful creation and application of this version, [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) is to spend a session in a therapy chamber in another dimension until they mentally recover, and are prepared to resume active duty.

## Description
[OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1) is a 2km by 2km by 2km structure located 800 meters below the earth's surface.
The exterior is composed of an unidentified metal, noted to be far more durable than any known naturally occurring material.
On the upper face of [OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1) has a small vault door, surrounded by multiple circular patterns in a ring around the entrance.
The interior of [OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1) is constructed of another unidentified substance, though it has very similar characteristics to concrete.
Exploration teams have determined that the interior possesses non-euclidian properties.
Gravity was also reported to constantly shift and change within [OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1).
The center of [OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1) is composed of a large complex of digital data storage units.
Examination of the complex has revealed that not only is it capable of containing an infinite amount of data, it also contains all the information of the entire history of the universe, including dozens of classified K-class events, and hundreds the Federation was unaware of.
The credibility of this data is confirmed by [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2). [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) is an individual of indeterminate age, gender, or ethnicity.
[OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) has been horribly disfigured, the top of their skull supposedly sawed off, with several 18 wires attaching their brain to [OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1)'s database.
The floor surrounding [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) is covered in a thin layer of salt.
[OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2)'s limbs are bound to the floor, and their eyes and mouth are perpetually forced open.
This has resulted in [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2)'s lips being completely worn down, with their jaw hanging open, and their eyes suffering severe damage due to exposure.
Despite this, [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) is alive, and is capable of moving their eyes, but nothing else.
Communication with [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) is possible via telepathy.
According to [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2)'s account, they have been on earth since its creation, have witnessed everything throughout history, and are forced to remember all of it via class Z amnestics.
They do not remember their name or origin, but have expressed a strong desire to escape [OCP-2000-1](ocp/2000-1) and participate in the world they are forced to witness.
This has led to the Federation putting their efforts towards assisting [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) in their removal.

The following is an interview between [OCP-2000-2](ocp/2000-2) and Dr. Talos.
