## Optimal Containment Protocols
At the request of [Z5-9](staff/z5-9), OCP-015 was destroyed via nuclear bombardment. This has successfully nullified all anomalous properties of the area.

## Description
OCP-015 is an isolated location in <Redacted>Wherever</Redacted>, and is usually completely unoccupied.
On rare occasion, a newlywed couple will be teleported to the location.
During their stay, they will receive letters claiming to be from relatives and friends.
While they do not actually send any letters, the letters received are incredibly accurate to what the individual would write.
The one exception being direct family members who have cut contact, with their letters often containing discouraging or disapproving content.
