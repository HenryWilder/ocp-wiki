## Optimal Containment Protocols
The area around OCP-024 is to be quarantined and permanently locked off, pending for demolition.

## Description
OCP-024 is an apartment building complex located in [DATA EXPUNGED].
The surrounding area is completely vacant.
The exterior of OCP-024 displays no anomalous properties, and is technically safe.
Upon entering one of the four instances through any available opening, OCP-024's properties will manifest.
Should the inhabitant make physical contact with the walls or ceiling of OCP-024, they will become stuck.
They will then be compelled to place their entire body on the wall or ceiling.
This will result in them being partly assimilated by the surface, and subsequently transmuting into more of said surface.
The remains will then develop holes along their body, through which an unidentified gas is secreted.
Victims have yet to display any form of distress during assimilation, and remain calm throughout the process.
