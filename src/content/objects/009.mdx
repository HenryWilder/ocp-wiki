## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-009 is to be kept in a 7m x 7m x 10m containment unit.
The unit is outfitted with high power spotlights aimed directly at OCP-009 at all times.
Access to OCP-009 is prohibited without approval from Z2 or above personnel.
All interactions with OCP-009 are required to have at least 3 armed bodyguards equipped with thermal visors and high caliber weapons.
In the event of a power outage, the containment unit is to be flooded with concrete.

## Description
OCP-009 is a clockwork candle that is constantly lighting and snuffing itself in ten (10) second intervals.
It never seems to run out of fuel or succumb to friction.
If someone is within five meters of the candle during a period of darkness, and the area around them is completely unlit, hostile entities will appear.
These entities are roughly equine in body structure, and are only visible through thermal or sonar equipment.
They are extremely hostile, and will persist after the candle has been lit again.
They have elongated limbs, and supposedly lack body hair.
They are somewhat resistant to most types of damage, and deceased instances will inexplicably dematerialize within 4 seconds.
If left alive, they will leave the area and attack anything that has organs functionally similar to white light sensitive eyes.
Repeated testing has confirmed that the longer an individual is within OCP-009's current red zone, the more entities will appear, and at an accelerating rate.
