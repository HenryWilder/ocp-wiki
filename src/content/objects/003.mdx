## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-003 is to be kept under constant surveillance and only used when absolutely necessary. We cannot afford to lose this.
When necessary, a team composed of <Redacted>[REDACTED]</Redacted>, are to approach the situation with <Redacted>[REDACTED]</Redacted> in possession of 003.

## Description
OCP-003 is a seemingly standard magnifying glass.
The one outwardly obvious abnormality is that the operational section isn't constructed of glass, but a clear, luminescent substance.
If OCP-003 is used to observe an anomalous object, the observer will see the second anomaly as "radiating a dark energy" within the view of OCP-003.
This has made OCP-003 invaluable to the Federation.
