## Optimal Containment Protocols
To date, no method of containing OCP-022 has worked.
Federation agents are to monitor Food and Poisoning emergency phone lines in search of reports suspected of being related to OCP-022 incidents.
Once suspicions are confirmed, MTF operatives are to terminate any OCP-022 instances and administer amnestics to any witnesses to the event.

## Description
OCP-022 is a species of insect that has been observed spontaneously materializing on any food item.
The largest recorded instance has been three centimeters long.
OCP-022 will crawl on and about 2 meters around the food item without eating it or anything else.
They are not poisonous, are tasteless, and have yet to cause any casualties.

In summary: OCP-022 is harmless, but very obnoxious.
