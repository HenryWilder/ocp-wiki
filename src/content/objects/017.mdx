## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-017 is to be treated like any other member of the [Z5 Council](staff/z5-council),
with the exception being he should be kept away from any sentient or otherwise unpredictable anomalies until they are properly contained.
Any objects within OCP-017's vicinity should be suspected of being anomalous.

## Description
OCP-017 is a relatively short adult male, and is a member of the [Z5 Council](staff/z5-council).
While possessing numerous uncommon abilities, he only has one truly anomalous property.
For some inexplicable reason, anomalous objects and entities are drawn towards OCP-017's physical being.
OCPs [006](ocp/006), [009](ocp/009), [023](ocp/023), and [051](ocp/051)
have all expressed abnormal behavior while interacting with OCP-017.
Aside from those examples, anomalies are somehow drawn towards OCP-017 through probable, but unlikely circumstances.
This often manifests as said anomalous objects falling on OCP-017's head, giving the impression that he is extremely unlucky.
