## Optimal Containment Protocols 
The town near OCP-1680 is to be evacuated and converted into a Federation site.
The perimeter around the lake is to be lined with yellow fluorescent paint.
Site researchers are forbidden from stepping beyond the line for any reason.


## Description
OCP-1680 is a small diner located in the middle of the [REDACTED] lake, suspended several meters off the surface by a large boulder and two walls of concrete.
Exploration teams dispatched to OCP-1680 have reported minor structural anomalies, including logically improbable features.
The plumbing within OCP-1680 seems to function as expected of a building from its era, even though there are no records of plumbing systems being implemented at any point.
By far the strangest property of OCP-1680 is the fact that observers claim that OCP-1680 is surrounded by land, and that they can walk to it without issue.
This has led to several individuals walking into the lake and not attempting to suspend themselves above the surface of the water, drowning along the way.


## Testing log
<TL1680_1/>
1: Subject was instructed to reach OCP-1680.
The subject proceeded to walk into the lake, floating to the surface two minutes later having expired due to asphyxiation approximately eight meters from the shore.
Autopsy of the body confirmed that the subject did not drown, nor were their air passages restricted.

<TL1680_2/>
2: Subject was instructed to reach a structure on the other side of the <Redacted>[REDACTED]</Redacted> lake without interacting with OCP-1680.
Subject becomes agitated, protesting the futility of swimming that far.
Subject was given Federation grade scuba gear outfitted with automatic adrenaline pumps to prevent exhaustion.
Subject successfully reached the other side without issue.

<TL1680_3/>
3: Subject was equipped with a video and audio recording device and instructed to approach OCP-1680.
Live feed shows nothing unusual until below the surface of the water.
Upon the subject entering the water, the video displays OCP-1680 at the center of a field.
It is not suspended by any objects or structures, sitting neatly on the ground.
Strangely, the color of the sky shifts from blue to green the closer the subject gets to OCP-1680.
No other visual anomalies are observed, the grass and dirt remain the same color throughout the experiment.
After two minutes, the camera falls to the ground before fading to a view of the lake floor as the subject expires due to asphyxiation.


Note from site researcher: "Oh. That explains it." 

<TL1680_4/>
4: An exploration team consisting of six field operatives equipped with video, audio, and atmospheric monitoring equipment, along with advanced breathing apparatuses, are sent to OCP-1680 by boat.
The boat sank to the lake floor, despite post-exploration analysis showing no structural damage to the boat.
Live video feed displays the same content as shown in test [1680 3](#test-log-1680-3). Operatives are instructed to continue towards OCP-1680.
Again, the sky changes from blue to green the closer the team gets to the building.
The team successfully reaches OCP-1680.
The team located at the shore do not report any sightings of the exploration team.
Exploration team safely analyzes the building without incident.
Post-exploration analysis confirms that the cause of death in most previous incidents occurred due to the atmosphere surrounding OCP-1680 changing from nitrogen to sulfur.


## Addenda
### Addendum 1
"Upon further inspection of the footage gathered from the fourth exploration, we believe we have detected several silhouettes in the distance several times.
The exploration team is thankfully unharmed, but we should consider making more expeditions in hopes of making contact with these presumed 'entities'."
