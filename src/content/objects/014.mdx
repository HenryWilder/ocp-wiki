## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-014 is currently hidden from public observation, though should someone encounter OCP-014, no intervention is necessary.

## Description
OCP-014 is a 4.6 meter tall acoustic mirror located in <Redacted>####</Redacted>.
Within a spherical area, 1cm in diameter, at the center of OCP-014's dish, all of the sound in the universe currently taking place is replicated.
Physical matter is somehow unaffected by the literally immeasurable noise, with the only exception being creatures capable of perceiving sound.
Such creatures, upon placing their ears (or otherwise equivalent organs), immediately explode.
These properties are constant, regardless of which universe it is placed in.
The only thing that changes is which universe it's copying, that being whichever one it's currently in.
In universes without sound, such as those having completed the process of heat death, OCP-014 expresses no unusual activity.
