## Optimal Containment Protocols
All OCP-012 incidents are to be covered up and [class G amnestics](amnestics/g) are to be administered to any surviving witnesses.
Class C worldwide mind control devices are being used to prevent the thought of [OCP-012-1](ocp/012-1) from forming, however this is not a guaranteed solution.
As a reminder, use of class B or above mind control devices is prohibited unless immediate danger is present.
All instances of [OCP-012-2](ocp/012-2) are to be tranquilized and incinerated.

## Description
[OCP-012-1](ocp/012-1) is a mathematical formula that results in a grizzly bear manifesting near whoever simplifies it, the bear being referred to as [OCP-012-2](ocp/012-2).
This is the result of the answer literally being a bear.
The answer does not need to be written down, simply thinking of the answer will cause [OCP-012-2](ocp/012-2) to appear.
Because [OCP-012-1](ocp/012-1) is a mathematical equation, and thus an idea, future OCP-012 incidents are considered inevitable.
[OCP-012-2](ocp/012-2) is more aggressive than natural bears, though not supernaturally so.
