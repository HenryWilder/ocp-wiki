## Optimal Containment Protocols
All clouds known to grow OCP-023 are to be caught by a team of available MTFs and brought to Federation custody.
At least two instances of [OCP-006](ocp/006) are to be given to the instance within custody.

## Description
OCP-023 is technically a weather phenomenon in which hundreds of 230cm thick black and purple tentacles protrude from a viable cloud.
These tentacles will attack anything below them and pull anything killed up into the cloud.
When an instance of [OCP-006](ocp/006) is below an instance of OCP-023, OCP-023 will grab [006](ocp/006) as expected.
However, after approximately 20 minutes, the [006](ocp/006) will be lowered back to the ground by the tentacles, filled with an unknown substance.
It is unknown what the purpose or effect of this behavior is.
OCP-023 is considered a parasite to [OCP-006](ocp/006), but it is possible the two have a more symbiotic relationship,
given that [OCP-006](ocp/006) will actively approach OCP-023 instances within the area.
