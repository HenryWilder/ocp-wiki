## Optimal Containment protocols
[OCP-051-1](ocp/051-1), [OCP-051-2](ocp/051-2), and [OCP-051-3](ocp/051-3) are provided standard midsized animal containment,
with the exception of not having mandatory feeding and cleaning cycles.

[OCP-051-&Oslash;1](ocp/051-Oslash1) is to be hunted down immediately and brought into a highly specialized containment cell.
[OCP-051-&Oslash;1](ocp/051-Oslash1)'s containment cell is outfitted with a system of pipes that will flood the chamber with concrete,
trapping [OCP-051-&Oslash;1](ocp/051-Oslash1) within until a more morally acceptable method is discovered.
Any instances of [OCP-051-&Oslash;2](ocp/051-Oslash2) are to be brought into Federation custody and placed in similar containment cells.
Those infected with [OCP-051-&Oslash;2](ocp/051-Oslash2) should be treated similarly to [OCP-051-&Oslash;1](ocp/051-Oslash1),
with additional mind-numbing agents when applicable.

## Initial Description
[OCP-051-1](ocp/051-1), [OCP-051-2](ocp/051-2), and [OCP-051-3](ocp/051-3) are a trio of groomed German shepherds with multiple body parts replaced with anomalous prosthetics.
All three have roughly rectangular visors covering their eyes (it is theorized that they do not have eyes at all)
mechanically augmented legs, and several glowing panels along their spines. All of their mechanical components are lined with colored
glowing panels and illegible runes, the colors referred to as "tags" ([OCP-051-1](ocp/051-1) is red, [OCP-051-2](ocp/051-2) is blue, and [OCP-051-3](ocp/051-3) is green).
[OCP-051-1](ocp/051-1), [OCP-051-2](ocp/051-2), and [OCP-051-3](ocp/051-3) are far stronger, faster, and more agile than other members of their species.
They are also much more easily trained, able to learn and follow commands much faster than expected. 

To date, no method of harming OCP-051 has been effective. For all intents and purposes, they are invincible.
The exact nature of their invulnerability is the cause of several other anomalous features.
They are neither warm nor cold, they do not affect and are not affected by the temperature of the area around them.
It is impossible to perform x-ray analysis on OCP-051, as the waves bounce off of their fur and skin.
Antimatter weaponry also has no effect on OCP-051. DNA sample analysis of OCP-051 is impossible, though collection of samples via hair and saliva is.
OCP-051 do not need to eat or produce waste, though they can digest all physical matter that has been tested. 

What makes OCP-051 so incredibly valuable to the Federation is their ability to locate members of a genus with a single sample.
This has been invaluable in tracking down instances of OCPs such as [006](ocp/006) and [030](ocp/030).
For this reason, OCP-051 are used in [MTF-K-nis](mtf/k-nis) for hunting missions.

## Addenda

### Addendum 1
**Dated <Redacted>00</Redacted>03|05|19**\
All three instances of OCP-051 are discovered sitting in front of a cave entrance amongst the skeletal remains of several large animals.
They quickly approach OCP staff, greeting them with excited barking and panting.
Within the cave itself are the remains of their presumed owner, who was crushed between two boulders.
The owner is later confirmed to be an ancestor of Daring Do.

### Addendum 2
**Dated <Redacted>00</Redacted>03|05|20**\
X-ray analysis on OCP-051 proves impossible, as the radiation fails to pass through their fur.
Tests involving high power rifles and anomalous weaponry reveal that OCP-051 are indestructible.
Several staff are resuscitated from their panic and heart attacks.
DNA analysis reveals [OCP-051-3](ocp/051-3) to be the offspring of alpha and beta.
Temperature readings indicate OCP-051 do not have temperatures, in that they are not "warm" or "cold",
they simply do not affect and are not affected by the temperature of their environment.

### Addendum 3
**Dated <Redacted>00</Redacted>03|05|20**\
Runes and engraving similar to those found on OCP-051 are discovered by Canis Do in the <Redacted>[Redacted]</Redacted> temple,
though translations are still absent.

## Updated Description
[OCP-051-1](ocp/051-1), [OCP-051-2](ocp/051-2), and [OCP-051-3](ocp/051-3) still match their previous description.

The recently created [OCP-051-&Oslash;1](ocp/051-Oslash1) is an anthropomorphic German shepherd/bat hybrid,
and possesses most traits of other OCP-051 instances. Her limbs, spine, and eyes are replaced with metal and stone parts covered in white runes.
Apart from that, she likely possesses an altered instance of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2), henceforth known as [OCP-051-&Oslash;2](ocp/051-Oslash2).
While the exact details of [OCP-051-&Oslash;2](ocp/051-Oslash2)'s appearance, properties, and personality are unknown,
the risk of them possessing both the properties of the other OCP-051 instances and [OCP-051-2](ocp/051-2)
is enough of a concern to warrant an immediate response. This is an immortality plague.
