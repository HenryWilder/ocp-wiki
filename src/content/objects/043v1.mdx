## Optimal Containment Protocols
Shipments and stores suspected of containing OCP-043 are to be intercepted and examined.
All OCP-043 products are to be exposed to process X892 (Dot Disconnect), and all individuals infected with OCP-043 are to be incinerated.

OCP-043 is a brand of coffee, usually packaged as grinds in a 25lb yellow tin can with the words

On a molecular level, OCP-043 is technically no different from normal commercial coffee.

and will constantly advertise OCP-043 to anyone and everyone. This ability has been deemed too absolute to safely contain,
and all individuals who consume OCP-043 are considered high priority threats.

    For the last time, it does not matter who has ingested OCP-043.
    It doesn't matter if they were your family, friends, or lovers.
