## Optimal Containment Protocols

[OCP-001](#description) is to be kept in a 5m x 5m x 5m hyperbolic time chamber set to 1:0.00001 scale (1 second outside is 0.00001 inside).
This is to be increased to 1:0.000001 scale once technology provides a reliable way of sustaining such scale.
Any items found inside of [OCP-001](#description) are to be sorted, contained, and scheduled for research.

## Description

[OCP-001](#description) is a wooden treasure chest dating back to <RedactedDate/>.
Most, but not all, items from [OCP-001](#description) manipulate time in some way, and [OCP-001](#description) refills itself whenever it becomes empty for a random period of time.
The recorded refill rate ranges between mere nanoseconds to <Redacted>REDACTED</Redacted>. The more valuable something is, the more extreme the effects.

### OCP-001-1
[OCP-001-1](#ocp-001-1): Affectionately known as "one ones" (1:1s) by staff, 1:1s are the most common object found in [OCP-001](#description).
They are small gold coins matching those used during [OCP-001](#description)'s estimated era. Whenever a 1:1 is exchanged for a good or service, the "spender" will reverse age by one day.
The number of 1:1s produced by [OCP-001](#description) is connected to how valuable other new objects within [OCP-001](#description) would be in <RedactedDate/>.
Certain items have been so valuable and powerful that [OCP-001](#description) geysered out 1:1s. 1:1 instances can be melted down into normal gold with no anomalous properties.

### OCP-001-2-A
[OCP-001-2-A](#ocp-001-2-a): [OCP-001-2-A](#ocp-001-2-a)s are medium-sized sapphires.
Holding an instance of [OCP-001-2-A](#ocp-001-2-a) in front of someone's eye will show them meals they will eat within the next 5
to <Redacted>0000</Redacted>hours, the duration being determined by the quality of the sapphire.

> Stop holding instances of [OCP-001-2-A](#ocp-001-2-a) to my face expecting to see my husband's genitalia.
> Not only is it none of your business, [OCP-001-2-A](#ocp-001-2-a)s only display actual food.

### OCP-001-2-B

[OCP-001-2-B](#ocp-001-2-b): 2-Bs are pearls ranging in size between 10cm to <Redacted>REDACTED</Redacted>.
Physical contact with an instance of [OCP-001-2-B](#ocp-001-2-b) will inflict the victim with a disease they've had at some point in their life.
Duration and lethality are determined by the size of the pearls, regardless of potential market value.
Testing has confirmed that mental disorders such as depression can be caused by [OCP-001-2-B](#ocp-001-2-b), while [OCP-029](TODO)
cannot be recreated. Testing has also shown that [OCP-001-2-B](#ocp-001-2-b)s work by literally recreating the exact bacteria/fungi/virus that they cause,
implying that they are pulling the disease from the past for infection.
All diseases can be cured by [SCP-500](TODO) if the severity doesn't instantly kill the victim.
The reason [OCP-001-2-A](#ocp-001-2-a)s and 001-2-Bs are placed in the same numeric category is because they both have relatively equal value,
with the smallest [OCP-001-2-B](#ocp-001-2-b)s producing the same number of 1:1s as the lowest quality [OCP-001-2-A](#ocp-001-2-a), and the same can be said for the largest and most refined of each.

### OCP-001-3
[OCP-001-3](#ocp-001-3): [OCP-001-3](#ocp-001-3)s are gold plated candelabras with varying numbers of labra, ranging from 2 to 20, totaling in 3 to 21 possible candles respectively.
As expected, the number of labra corresponds with the "value" of each [OCP-001-3](#ocp-001-3) instance, but the extremity of the effects are consistent regardless of candle capacity.
The potency of the effect is instead determined by the number of candles lit at any given time within a 5 meter radius, with large groups providing the most extreme effects.
Whenever a candle is lit on a [OCP-001-3](#ocp-001-3) instance, the laws of thermodynamics are altered within a 30 meter radius,
causing all things aside from the candles to be unable to transfer energy. This prevents electronics and muscle tissue within the affected area from functioning,
and will instantly kill anything that allows their brain to enter the area of effect. The area is increased by 7 meters per candle within 5 meters of each other.
However, if one [OCP-001-3](#ocp-001-3) is lit outside of the area of effect of two [OCP-001-3](#ocp-001-3)s that are within each other's area, the first instance will have an increased range.
This effect goes away once the candles are put out, which usually occurs naturally after about an hour.

### OCP-001-4
[OCP-001-4](#ocp-001-4): [OCP-001-4](#ocp-001-4) is currently uncontained, but was one of the first things to appear within [OCP-001](#description).
It was the first documented case of OCP-001 geysering out 1:1s, which occurred while it was being lifted to site-01 via helicopter.
This was also during an attack from goi.01, the Rainbow Factory. The Rainbow Factory managed to seize [OCP-001-4](#ocp-001-4), and it is unknown what it was capable of,
what exactly it was, or what it was being used for before the Rainbow Factory was shut down.

<p style="color:transparent">I'm actually proud of this one.</p>
