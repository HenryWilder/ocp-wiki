> <Redacted>Outgoing response</Redacted> at <RedactedDate/> 6:31:05\
> How should I know? Did you check the written documents?

## Addenda

### Addendum 019 1
On several occasions, OCP-019 has breached containment.
Apparently, researchers mistook OCP-019 for an ordinary potato, questioned why it was contained, and attempted to dispose of it.
To all those wondering why OCP-019 is classified as [Verj](class/verj), this is why.

### Addendum 019 2
Why the hell did this thing follow us here? How did it survive? Does it like us or something?
