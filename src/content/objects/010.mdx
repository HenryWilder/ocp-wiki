## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-010 is kept in a standard inanimate object containment locker at [site-03](site/03).

## Description
OCP-010 is a pair of custom made red heart-print boxer shorts that possess no anomalous properties so long as they are left unused.
While worn by an individual, seemingly improbable though possible events will occur around the individual that will cause any and all attempts to conceal OCP-010 to fail.
This only works on bipedal entities, thus requiring tests to be conducted within the anthropomorphic sectors.
