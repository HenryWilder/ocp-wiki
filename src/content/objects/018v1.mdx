## Optimal Containment Protocols
OCP-018 is kept in a standard livestock containment unit at site-<Redacted>??</Redacted>, and provided with at least 80 pounds of chicken feed per week.
If OCP-018 ever breaches containment, the on site nuclear warhead is to be detonated.

## Description
OCP-018 is a sentient entity covered in white feathers, and constantly emits noises associated with the domesticated chicken.
It is biologically identical to a domesticated chicken.
An ample description of OCP-018 as provided by a junior staff member is "if a fuck ton of chickens clipped into each other and looked in different directions."
This is accurate.
OCP-018 has a varying number of body parts, all of which seem unable to make contact with each other and often shift about,
but usually has a minimum of 18 legs, 10 tails, 20 wings, and 17 eyes.
OCP-018 is incredibly durable, able to survive for several hours underwater and direct impacts from tank shells.
After these tests, OCP-018 temporarily became extremely hostile, killing 13 Federation staff members and injuring 9.
OCP-018, having as many eyes as it does, is capable of observing all of its surroundings simultaneously.
It is theorized that OCP-018 is omnipotent, but this has yet to be proven.
