## Optimal Containment Protocols
~~[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is to be held within a standard humanoid containment cell with padded walls and a minimum of four (4) cameras for continuous observation at all times.
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is to be restrained by any means necessary to prevent self-termination.~~

The <Redacted>[REDACTED]</Redacted> forest near [site-07.<Redacted>##</Redacted>](site/07) is to be regularly searched for instances of [OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3).
Any instances found are to be destroyed using either a solution of chlorine bleach or incineration at temperatures in excess of 3000°C (3273.15°K).

### UPDATE FOLLOWING [INCIDENT 350 <Redacted>##</Redacted>](#incident-350-00)
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is to be left uncontained and unmonitored in the <Redacted>[REDACTED]</Redacted>
forest near [site-07.<Redacted>##</Redacted>](site/07).
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is permitted access to the civilian area surrounding [site-07.<Redacted>##</Redacted>](site/07),
under the condition that all activities of OCP-350 are monitored during visits.

A minimum 2.5ml sample of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) reserved for tracking purposes is to be contained on [site-07.<Redacted>##</Redacted>](site/07) at all times.
More is permitted, but not less.

Once per month, at the discretion of the interrogator, [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is to be located and captured for debriefing.
~~If [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s location is not immediately obvious, Mobile Task Force [K-nis (Bloodhounds)](mtf/k-nis)
is to be dispatched for subject tracking.~~

Debriefing is to catalog the locations and physical descriptions of [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s offspring, and by extension, [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2)'s offspring.
Due to a consistent lack of success when questioning [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) regarding the locations & quantity of [OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3),
such lines of questioning have been deemed "a waste of time" and "not to be bothered with".

### UPDATE FOLLOWING INCIDENT 350 <Redacted>##</Redacted>
Outside of testing, no more than one (1) kilogram of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) is to be stored without walled separation.
Tests involving quantities of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) in excess of 1kg require the written permission of the site director.

### UPDATE FOLLOWING INCIDENT 350 <Redacted>##</Redacted>
Threatening and torture are no longer to be administered as methods of extracting information.
Physical restraints are permitted during interrogations, but must not give OCP-350 a sense of being trapped.

### UPDATE FOLLOWING INCIDENT 350 <Redacted>##</Redacted>
Mobile Task Force K-nis (Bloodhounds) is not to be utilized for tracking [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1).
The risk of causing an &Oslash;K-class End-Of-Death Scenario has been deemed unacceptably high.\
\
Research into alternative means of tracking [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is ongoing.\
\
Until an acceptable alternative is found, it has been deemed temporarily permissible to reward [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) with larger quantities of fruit and moderated access to 
<Blurred>unjustifiable amounts of <Redacted>reproduction</Redacted></Blurred> in the hopes that [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) associates
the Federation with consistent & convenient rewards in exchange for information, so that the object willingly returns on a semi-regular basis.

## Description
OCP-350 is a collection of objects designated "[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)" and "[OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2)", in addition to a classification of anomalous nodes designated "[OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3)".

The anomalous properties of OCP-350 include [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2)'s ability to consciously manipulate quantum superposition probability at will.
This property enables [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) to, as most frequently observed, bring [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) back from the dead.
This property has been confirmed to remanifest a living, and sometimes more youthful, instance of [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) at the position of an [OCP-350-3 Node](ocp/350-3).

<Comment>
    <CommentHeading user="drLastname">Commented on "at the position of an OCP-350-3 Node"</CommentHeading>
    It is unknown how the decision of which OCP-350-3 Node is selected is made, considering OCP-350-1 can perform this action even when
    measurements show its brain to be at or below 0.001% activity.\
    \
    It is speculated that the decision is either random, pre-determined by OCP-350-1 prior to incapacitation, consciously selected post-mortem by OCP-350-2,
    or made in accordance with an unknown physical law or algorithm.
</Comment>

Additionally of note is [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2)'s ability to modify the shape, but not the material, of anything within its near vicinity.
This is most frequently seen in [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s ability to "shapeshift", as described by researchers.

<Comment>
    <CommentHeading user="drLastname">Commented</CommentHeading>
    It's a miracle that OCP-350-2 is of such low intelligence that it is unable to comprehend how this property could allow it to easily breach containment.\
    OCP-350-1, however, is very much aware of its ability to dematerialize and remanifest on the other side of walls; or to simply dematerialize the wall itself.\
    \
    As such, while it has been deemed completely safe to store samples of OCP-350-2 (in discrete quantities less than one (1) kilogram),
    the containment of OCP-350-1 has been deemed a threat to the containment of other anomalies.\
    \
    It is preferred that the Federation hold good will with a docile OCP-350-1, over the risk of a site-wide "Meltdown" breach event.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is a 1m tall, female humanoid most closely related to the species Acerodon Jubatus (giant golden-crowned flying fox).
The object's most distinguishing feature is a pattern of small, circle-like shapes across the skin, where the epidermis & dermis are thin enough
for the muscle to be visible. [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s muscle scatters light similarly to the sky (appearing blue under direct, white light),
as well as emitting a purple glow at an intensity of 0.325 lumens. Testing has confirmed this is as a result of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) "staining" the muscle.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) displays both sentience and sapience, as well as basic fluency in the English language.
It is capable of carrying on full conversations in a wide range of subjects. While the object shows curiosity towards the Federation as well as civilization
in general, most conversations eventually converge on the topics of <Blurred><Redacted>creating offspring with</Redacted>
the interviewer</Blurred> or other anomalous objects. It is strongly advised that these topics are not entertained.\
Research into [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s knowledge of other anomalies, and how it was obtained, is ongoing.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) has a strong tendency towards disobeying orders and general non-compliance. It can be made to cooperate in exchange for rewards in the form of fruit.
Alternatively, [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) cooperates consistently when rewarded with access to
<Blurred>unjustifiable amounts of <Redacted>reproduction</Redacted></Blurred>.\
This is to be used sparingly however, as it comes with a high risk of contamination and/or infection.
Resulting biohazards are to be contained for study, or destroyed before they can form [OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3).

[OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) is a translucent black, mutated slime mold (Myxomycete) of variable density.
DNA tests show the object to be most closely related to the species Physarum Polycephalum.\
Like [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s muscle, [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) scatters incoming blue light, and emits a purple glow at an intensity of 3 lumens per gram.

Testing has determined that [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) is sentient and responds to certain forms of communication, but isn't believed to be sapient.

[OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) is genetically and biologically linked to its host, [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1).
In addition to sharing identical DNA, the two objects share a symbiotic bond: [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s body naturally produces [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) as if it were its own blood.
In return, [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) circulates oxygen and nutrients through [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s cardiovascular system, further acting as blood.

[OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3) are points containing highly concentrated samples of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2).
These points can have the appearance of a puddle or hole filled completely with black goo.
While such nodes are confirmed to be knowingly created by [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1), they can also be produced by any offspring of [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) or offspring of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2).

All interviews with [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) regarding [OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3) have resulted in extremely limited success, if any.
~~It is generally accepted among all interviewers that [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) is either willfully lying or misremembering.~~

### UPDATE FOLLOWING [ADDENDUM <Redacted>##</Redacted>](#addendum-00)
Recent interviews have shown that neither of these cases is true.
Following an investigation of one of the [OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3) locations provided by [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1),
it was observed that [OCP-350-3 Nodes](ocp/350-3) are not static as previously believed, and consciously evade observation & capture.
This is believed to be a survival tactic of OCP-350 collectively.

## Discovery

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) was discovered on <RedactedDate/> breaking into a local 24-hr convenience store at <Blurred>0226</Blurred>hrs.
The object was consuming a quantity of <Blurred>Frooti Tooti&trade;</Blurred>-brand packets of <Blurred>Bunni Gummis</Blurred>
(animal-shaped, artificial fruit-flavored gummy snacks) from a display stand it had knocked onto the floor.

When spotted on security cameras by night manager <Redacted>xxxxxxxxxxx</Redacted>, the night manager approached [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) in the main area.
[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) acknowledged the night manager's presence, but ignored requests to compensate for damage and consumed product.
The night manager produced a <Redacted>model name</Redacted> shotgun from behind the front counter. When threatened,
the object vocalized hostility and hugged the unconsumed packets to its chest using its wings.
The night manager fired at [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1), terminating the object instantly and splattering the floor with [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2).

While the part of the camera that would have been viewing [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)'s corpse was obscured by a quantity of [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) covering it,
an instance of [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) can be seen in the frame immediately following the shotgun flash, hiding on the opposite side of the display stands.

<Comment>
    <CommentHeading user="drLastname">Commented</CommentHeading>
    Early on, it was suspected that OCP-350-1's anomalous property was faster-than-light speed, but later research &dash; as well as a distinct
    absence of any air displacement shifting hanging products &dash; quickly dispelled this theory.
</Comment>

OCP officials were soon dispatched to the site when the night manager called law enforcement reporting the termination,
and the communication was interrupted by a loud vocalization of distress from the night manager upon seeing [OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1)
walking around the corner to collect any packets of gummy snacks that may have survived the shotgun blast.

[OCP-350-1](ocp/350-1) was later captured and contained, using some of the [OCP-350-2](ocp/350-2) residue left behind in the convenience store to train
Mobile Task Force [K-nis (Bloodhounds)](mtf/k-nis) on its scent.
