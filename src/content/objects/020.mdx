## Optimal Containment Protocols
All footage of OCO-020 is to be destroyed, and all witnesses are to be given class A amnestics. Otherwise, OCP-020 is to be left alone.

OCP-020 is a sapient entity that sometimes appears in houses where the occupants have left without turning off the lights.
OCP-020 will turn off all of the lights while mumbling about how the family is wasting money and power.
It's form is somehow indescribable, but always gives a sense of "paternal presence".
