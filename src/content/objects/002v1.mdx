## Optimal Containment Protocols
Federation staff are to work 24/7 to locate and track the origin of OCP-002's broadcasts.
Any incidents related to OCP-002 are to be covered up, and all witnesses are to be administered class E amnestics.
Due to OCP-002 being relatively localized within its area, it is considered a low priority threat.

## Description
OCP-002 is the designation given to an anomalous series of radio waves of unknown origin,
focusing on the area known as <Redacted>xxxxxxx</Redacted> County.
These frequencies are almost completely harmless so long as they are not being translated by a form of television.
Due to the nature of radio waves, OCP-002 is essentially always active.
Whenever any individual is surfing television stations in <Redacted>xxxxxxx</Redacted> County,
there is a chance they will see an option call ed "Devour TV".
They are free to ignore this option. Should they select "Devour TV", the screen will display a random image.
Through unknown means, this image will prevent the viewer from breaking line of sight with the television and occasionally mumble incoherently.
This will continue for anywhere from a few minutes to an hour until the top and bottom of the screen start developing jagged shapes resembling spikes,
which will slowly close in on the image. Once they fully close, the viewer <Blurred>enters a state of ext</Blurred>reme distress
fol<Blurred>lowed by the appearance of lacerations
and</Blurred> <Blurred>cuts resembling</Blurred> bite marks.
