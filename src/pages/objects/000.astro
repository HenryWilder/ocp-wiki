                Frankly, I don't even remember putting any candy wrappers in my pockets, but it was managing to pull them out anyway.
                I didn't wany those wrappers or anything, they're just trash, but I definitely didn't want it GETTING them so I started grabbing for em myself!

                    At this moment, the witness started screming and pointing at an empty corner of the room.
                    A security officer was asked to examine the space. Within moments, the guard vanished into a cloud of black smoke.
                    His next of kin were told the cause of death was smoke inhalation followed by spontaneous physical dissolvement.
