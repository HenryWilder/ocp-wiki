After running a suitable number of tests to determine if it even belongs in such &quot;be and leave be&quot; style sites, site-08 will determine where it should go and do their best to hypothesize what containment protocols would be best suited for the current specimen.<br><br>Site-08 is currently out of commission due to an accident involving an anomalous tennis racket." },

One cell might contain a friendly thought-inserting octopus, the next might contain a ravenous time-altering predator. Of course, site-14 doesn't just hold animals. Sapient plant-based entities are also held here. If something is alive, it's automatically unpredictable, and site-14 is prepared for whatever it has in store." },

The staff call the apparatus used to get rid of the garbage that comes their way &quot;the incinerator&quot; due to how it works, but in reality it's another OCP. What are its properties? Even the staff on site aren't sure, but they like to think it incinerates trash without harming the environment." },
